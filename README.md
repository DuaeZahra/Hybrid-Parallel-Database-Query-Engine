# Hybrid-Parallel-Database-Query-Engine
This project aims to accelerate database query execution using a hybrid parallel approach, combining CPU-based parallelism (OpenMP) and GPU-based acceleration (CUDA). The expected outcome is a significant reduction in query execution time through efficient workload distribution between CPU and GPU, leading to improved performance and scalability.
